# samdx1

This guide explains how to modify memory addresses and memory allocation size for the [UF2-SAMDX1 bootloader](https://github.com/adafruit/uf2-samdx1) and [Arduino core](https://github.com/adafruit/ArduinoCore-samd) to allow for other MPUs (micro-processing units) that are not currently supported. This is a useful technique for those who are looking to work with boards that are not yet supported by the existing bootloader and core.
